# Online-Library-Management-System

The Online Library Management System is a console-based program developed using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The system is designed to help manage basic library activities such as adding and removing books, searching for available books, and allowing users to borrow and return books.  The aim of this project is to apply core OOP principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, modularity, and reusability in a practical way. Through this system, the project demonstrates how these concepts can be used to create a simple, organized, and efficient library management solution.
